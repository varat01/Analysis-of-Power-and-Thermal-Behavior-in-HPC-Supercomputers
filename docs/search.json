    "text": "1 Introduction\nThis topic combines my domain knowledge expertise in power and thermal phenomena with an area I have interest in further exploring, HPC supercomputers. HPC supercomputers are used for solving highly complex problems that require immense computational power by combining high speed networking and thousands of processors. There are some power and thermal issues that can arise which can lead to performance degradation, increased power consumption, and reduced hardware longevity. I aim to study and further explore trends with the following questions: What is the relationship between power draw and temperature across CPUs and GPUs? Can we visually identify anomalies such as sudden temperature spikes, power surges, or cooling failures? Do nodes show increasing temperatures at the same power level over time suggesting reduced thermal performance?",

I will be using a_fullperiod_10sec_58hosts.tar which is one of the sample subsets in that dataset package. It contains 10-second mean telemetry (power + temperature) across 58 nodes, spanning multiple months between 2020–2022.\nThe data is collected by the lab’s systems administrators and monitoring infrastructure. It is sampled at 1 Hz for multiple nodes across the supercomputer. The format is in parquet files where each contains time series measurements for multiple nodes. The data fields include information such as time stamps, hostname/node ID, CPU and GPU power and temperature readings, and some additional sensor readings. The data collection was completed in 2022 for this set, therefore it is no longer actively being updated.",
