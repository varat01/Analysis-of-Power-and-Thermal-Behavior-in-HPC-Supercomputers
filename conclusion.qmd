# Conclusion
Across the three sampled nodes, power and temperature behaved in directly correlated patterns that reflected their computational loads. The analysis examined only a small subset of the full supercomputer system, so longer time spans and more nodes would be needed to confirm system wide patterns. Future work could incorporate airflow patterns, predictive models to improve early detection of non uniform aging or degradation, and metadata to identify causes behind thermal and power anomalies. Overall, the project still demonstrated how exploratory visualization can reveal important operational behaviors in large scale computing systems.
