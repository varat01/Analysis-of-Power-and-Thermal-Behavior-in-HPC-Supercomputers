# Conclusion
Across the three sampled nodes, the exploration revealed several consistent patterns. Power and temperature increased together for both CPUs and GPUs, showing clear power–thermal coupling. Visualizing the data over time also uncovered anomalies such as extended heat spikes on node c03n13 and frequent high power bursts on a07n04 which may indicate temporary cooling stress, sustained workloads, or potential for non-uniform aging. The analysis focused on only three nodes over a single week, limiting the ability to generalize to the entire system. Future work could incorporate airflow patterns, larger scale sampling to better understand long term trends, predictive models to improve early degradation detection, and metadata to identify causes behind anomalies. A key lesson learned is techniques like faceting and anomaly highlighting made it possible to see relationships between the nodes that are not able to be seen in raw logs. Overall, the project still demonstrated how exploratory visualization can reveal important operational behaviors in large scale computing systems.
