This project focuses on the analysis and visualization of power and thermal behavior in HPC supercomputers using telemetry data from Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The goal is to explore patterns, relationships, and potential anomalies in CPU and GPU power consumption and temperature dynamics across compute nodes.
