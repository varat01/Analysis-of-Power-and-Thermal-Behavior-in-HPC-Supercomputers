# Introduction

This topic combines my domain knowledge expertise in power and thermal phenomena with an area I have interest in further exploring, HPC supercomputers. HPC supercomputers are used for solving highly complex problems that require immense computational power by combining high speed networking and thousands of processors. There are some power and thermal issues that can arise which can lead to performance degradation, increased power consumption, and reduced hardware longevity. I aim to study and further explore trends with the following questions: What is the relationship between power draw and temperature across CPUs and GPUs? Can we visually identify anomalies such as sudden temperature spikes, power surges, or cooling failures? Do nodes show increasing temperatures at the same power level over time suggesting reduced thermal performance?
